# What's common between the best researchers and founders?

Source: [Researchers and Founders](https://blog.samaltman.com/researchers-and-founders)

The best people in both groups are quite different on average.

7 things common betwen them
1. Spend a **lot of time reflecting** on some version of the **Hamming question** - ***"What are the most important problems in your field, and why aren't you working on them?"***
2. Laser focus on the **next step** in front of them as well as **long-term vision**.
3. **Extremely persistent** and **hard working**.
4. **Bias towards action and trying things**, and **clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isn’t**.
5. **Creative idea-generators** — a lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage.
6. Really **value autonomy**.
7. **Very driven by genuine curiosity.**
