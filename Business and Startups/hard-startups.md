Hard Startup
- Requires a lot of either/and
    - money
    - time
    - coordination
    - technological development
- Attracts more talented people in the long run as talented people want to work on something they find meaningful. Hard startups can attract talented people using their
    - mission
    - likelihood of massive success
    - quality of people
    - statement of "the world needs this, it won’t happen any time soon if we don’t do it, and we are much less likely to succeed if you don’t join."
-  If people care about your success because you seem committed to doing something significant, it’s a background force helping you with hiring, advice, partnerships, fundraising, etc.

Advice on doing hard startups
- Let yourself become more ambitious — figure out the most interesting version of where what you’re working on could go.  Then talk about that big vision and work relentlessly towards it, but always have a reasonable next step.
- Be willing to make a very long-term commitment to what you’re doing.

If it becomes difficult to hire many talented people
- think about startups that can become quite successful with less than ten people
