# Marketecture

A Marketecture is a non-technical representation of products, systems, services and how they interact and relate to one another.

Great, and why is it so important?!

A Marketecture not only forms the foundation for how your products are packaged, marketed, and sold, it also provides the vision for how your products will evolve.

It is used to help unify the various components of a product or service into a digestible format. Additionally, it helps illustrate what is core functionality (baked in, necessary) vs add-on (flexible, additive). A Marketecture should make it easy for an audience to understand how products and/or services work together to orchestrate a solution to a problem.
