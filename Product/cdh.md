> - **make better product decisions**
> - **chances that I will succeeed will dramatically increase**


# I. What is Continous Discovery

## Discovery vs Delivery

Discovery: The work I do to decide what to build.

Delivery: The work I do to build and ship a product.

Many companies put a heavy emphasis on delivery, but **discovery and delivery need to be balanced.**

> Teams should continously keep discovering new products to solve unmet customer needs and keep iterating on existing ones.
