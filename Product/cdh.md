Author: [Teresa Torres](https://www.producttalk.org/)

# Foreword

What Chris Mercury gained by practicing Continous Discovery Habits:

| Before                                       | After                                             |
|:---------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| Chopping and chaning discovery approach. Needing lots of meetings to work out what to do next | More structured discovery process. People knew what was expected of them and delivered more consistent results. |
| Superficial understanding of their customers. Heavy, infrequent research. | Developed deeper understanding of customer's needs, problems and desires through regular contact and lightweight research methods. |
| Having a list of metrics to increase and outputs to deliver. | Fewer goals, more clarity, a focus on solving the customer's problems in ways that drive business value. |
| Falling in love with a single idea and building it. | Come up with many ideas. Learn faster by testing sets of ideas and running smaller simulations. |
| Discovery and delivery were separate responsibilities. | More collaboration, with most of the team involved in customer interviews, mapping the customer journey, ideating on solutions, discussing results. Whole team contributes at key points along the way, learn and adjust course together. |
| Wait to show leaders big reports and presentations. | Have tools to show leaders team's thinking earlier and have better conversations about where to go next. |
|   | Improved customer and business outcomes. |
|   | Improved team's confidence that they knew what they were doing. After a few wins, team started to believe that they could achieve anything. |

## Introduction

This book will teach a *structured* and *sustainable* approach to continous discovery that will help me answer the following questions:
- Am I making a product/service that my customers want?
- How do I ensure that I'm improving my product/service over time?
- How do I guarantee that my team is creating value for my customers in a way that creates value for my business?

> After reading this book and practicing the habits, product work will still be hard and I will still make plenty of mistakes, but I will 
> - **make better product decisions**
> - **dramatically increase my chances of success**


# I. What is Continous Discovery

## Discovery vs Delivery

Discovery: The work I do to decide what to build.

Delivery: The work I do to build and ship a product.

Many companies put a heavy emphasis on delivery, but **discovery and delivery need to be balanced.**

> Teams should continously keep discovering new products to solve unmet customer needs and keep iterating on existing ones.



# II. The 11 Habits



# III. Developing my Continuous Discovery Habits

1. **Build** my Trio and work together to decide what to build (can be more than 3 people, can be people that are design/PM/engineering-minded or are interested in these if Designers/PMs/Engineers are not available)
    - Guiding principle: *"How can I include all three disciplines in as many discovery decisions as I can? Make next week look better than last week. Repeat."*
2. Start Talking to Customers Every Week
    - Once my trio is in place, I'm ready to adopt this keystone habit of Continous Discovery.
    - Keystone habits are habits that, once adopted, drive the adoption of other habits.
    - Start small, talk to someone similar to my customers if I can't find a single customer to talk to. Use each conversation to get introduced to another person to talk to.
3. Work Backward
    - Ask the following 2 questions and I would have also built my first OST:
        - "If our customers had this solution, what would it do for them?"
            - If possible, ask this question to customers.
            - Try to uncover the implied opportunity. Consider customer needs, pain points and desires.
        - "If we shipped this feature, what value would it create for our business?"
            - Refine our answer until we get to a clear metric - that's our outcome. 
4. Use my Retrospectives to Reflect and Improve
5. Avoid these Common Anti-Patterns
    - Focusing on why a given strategy won't work (AKA "That will never work here"), instead of focusing on what is within my control.
    - Being the annoying champion for the "right way" of working.
    - Waiting for permission instead of starting with what is within my control.
