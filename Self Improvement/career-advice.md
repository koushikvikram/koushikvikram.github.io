## [Career Advice from Scott Adams](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html)

> *Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix. What are your three?* 

> *At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve **communication, either written or verbal**. And it could be as simple as **learning how to sell more effectively than 75% of the world**.*

If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:
1. Become the best at one specific thing.
2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.

I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Or get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law degree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever.

You’d be hard pressed to find any successful person who didn’t have about three skills in the top 25%.

## Matt Gray (Herb) - 10 years of learning in 5 minutes

This took me 10 years to learn, I’ll teach it to you in 5 minutes:

### 1. Optimize Your Health

In order to be successful you need to be at peak performance.

Every morning I:
- Do a guided mindfulness meditation
- Get sunlight in my eyes
- Lift heavy weights
- Stretch my body
- Write

Entrepreneurs are athletes.

Take training seriously.


### 2. Experiments are More Important Than Perfection

Get comfortable being uncomfortable:
- Write daily
- Publish daily
- Iterate on your product

Don’t wait.

Start now.

Hit send.

Done > Perfect


### 3. Build a Content System Day 1

Content increases your surface area for luck.

You need to build a system to:
- Follow a content schedule
- Build content formats
- Formulate a funnel

Stay consistent.

Hit publish daily and good things happen.


### 4. Build Your Revenue Funnel

The goal is to convert your dream customer to your product:
- Rented audience: Attract your dream customer on Twitter and LinkedIn
- Owned audience: Convert them to emails and SMS
- Monetized audience: Get them to pay for your product


### 5. Excellence is a Habit

You are what you continually do.

The Super Bowl is won in the preseason.

Your day begins the night before:
- Curate your priorities before you go to bed
- Wake up
- Complete 3 big tasks
- Go into nature
- Come back and tackle more
- Repeat


### 6. Fall in Love With The Process

There is no shortcut to success. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.

Enjoy the small wins:
- You wrote a draft. Great work.
- You sent a big email. Great work.
- You closed a small deal. Great work.

Success is about stacking tiny wins.


### 7. Be Obsessed With Learning

The most successful people are lifelong learners:
- Learn from people on LinkedIn
- Watch educational videos
- Listen to podcasts

“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.”


### 8. Your Network is Your Net Worth

Create your personal Board of Advisors.

Here’s mine:
- Crypto: Shaan Puri
- Sales: Alex Hormozi
- Writing: Dickie Bush
- Investing: Codie Sanchez
- Ecommerce: Amanda Goetz

Who are your advisors?


### 9. Have a Bias for Action

Get addicted to momentum.

If you know you should do something, do it in 5 seconds:
- Send the email
- Write the post
- Call that person
- Express gratitude

Don't wait.

Life is too short.

Take action and have fun.

That's it!
