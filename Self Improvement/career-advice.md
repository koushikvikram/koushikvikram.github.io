## [Career Advice from Scott Adams](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html)

> *Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix. What are your three?* 

> *At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve **communication, either written or verbal**. And it could be as simple as **learning how to sell more effectively than 75% of the world**.*

If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:
1. Become the best at one specific thing.
2. Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.

I always advise young people to become good public speakers (top 25%). Or get a degree in business on top of your engineering degree, law degree, medical degree, science degree, or whatever.

You’d be hard pressed to find any successful person who didn’t have about three skills in the top 25%.
