# [Embrace The Chaos - How India Taught Me to Stop Overthinking and Start Living - Bob Miglani](https://www.amazon.ca/Embrace-Chaos-Taught-Overthinking-Living/dp/1609948254)

"Hurry Sickness" is numbing our conscious awareness of what's really going on in our lives. Our very sense of humanity - our full presence in our own lives - is being hijacked by busyness. When we're hurrying, we rarely really know anyone. Instead, we live on the *assumption* that we know each other.

Remembering the impermanence of life each day helps us bring greater purpose to our step.

> An Indian wedding will teach you how to deal with uncertainty. While you may not be able to know what happens next and you feel as though there's no order to anything, two people *will* get married, and everything will seem perfect when it's all over. It all works out in the end. Just accept it. You just have to let go and go with the flow that leads you up to the end. **Enjoy the ride! If you focus too much on trying to figure out or control what comes next, you’ll miss the best time of your life and it will all be over before you know it.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Introduction 

> *YOU HAVE LESS CONTROL THAN YOU THINK. GET OVER IT!*

We have a deep desire to have some level of control over our lives. Somewhere along our journey in life, however, things don't work out as we expect them to, no matter how hard we try to control things. As a result, we get overwhelmed and consumed by the chaos, unable to move forward. We attempt to control but we cannot. This loss of control is the root of much of our stress and overthinking.

**In the beginning, it was difficult for me to accept that we may never have had control over life in the first place. For a long time, I fought the idea of letting go of control, but eventually I realized that we can never really conquer the chaos. We can only embrace it. After we embrace it, we can start reveling in it.**

> Letting go of control is a wonderfully freeing experience that opens us up to new, fresh possibilities. It brings out the strengths we never knew existed inside of us. It brings forward ideas hidden inside, which helps us to create, develop and flourish.

> It allows us to live freely because we're no longer feeling as though we're carrying the burden of the world on our shoulders. This doesn't mean we have to just give up and wait for things to happen. 

> **The only certainty we have is *ourselves.* We can work harder on controlling our thoughts, words, actions and responses, instead of wasting our energy on trying to control others or the conditions around us. This can be done using three principles:**
> **1. Accept the unpredictable, uncertain, imperfect and complicated nature of life and accept that the only control we have is over ourselves.**
> **2. Don't overthink. Stop overanalyzing, overplanning or trying to predict what will happen tomorrow because we can't control the future anyway. Why worry and miss out on some of the best times of our lives, happening around us right now?**
> **3. Move forward. Take action. Taking action can create more certainty than waiting around for perfection.**

India is a country bursting with the 4 forces of chaos that cause so many of us stress and worry:
- uncertainty
- unpredictability
- complexity
- speed

In India, one doesn't know what's going to happend next or when it's going to happen, and when it does happen, it seems scary and comes out of nowhere, fast! The place has a way of completely destroying any notions of control that we think we have and you realize it wasn't so bad afterall.

> Liberated from the shackles of an orderly framework that your mind no longer needs to control, you begin to **stop analyzing life and start living it**. For me, India's allure as a training ground was that, **despite** crumbling infrastructure, a complex society of many different castes, cultures, and languages, and extreme poverty and awful conditions, **people continue to be happy. They forge ahead in their lives and their work, sometimes with joy in their eyes, kindness in their hearts, and passionate effort. Despite the unpredictability, Indians continue to move forward.** 

> **Ultimately, I realized that learning to embrace the chaos** was not about fixing my career or quitting my job to live on some faraway island devoid of any chaos. For me, it **is more about learning to take action and participate in life, accepting that chaos of modern life will continue to exist - with or without my approval - and choosing to move forward anyway.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PART I - Accept

Accept that there is no perfect job, no perfect person, no perfect relationship, and no perfect life. There are only jobs, people, relationships, and life. **Accept it all as it is—good, bad, great, short, up-and-down, awful, crazy, and every way in between.**

> Accept that we cannot control life. We can only control ourselves — our thoughts, our words, and our actions.

Let go of all the old baggage. Let go of the ego. Let go of the way things used to be or the way you think they ought to be. Let go of past relationships, past ways of working, and the need to hang on to something that isn’t there anymore. Let go of trying to bring your order and your expectations to the outside world. Stop trying to control what crosses your path. **Just control yourself.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 1 - DRIVING ON INDIAN ROADS

> *YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE CHAOS. YOU CAN CONTROL YOU.*

The incessant need to be in control is just a way to stand in the middle of the road while life passes us by.

Chaos shouldn't concern us. Participating in life, despite the chaos that lies ahead in all paths, is our choice and ours alone, and it can be as simple as driving forward in any direction, whatever may come. Because eventually, despite a cow or two blocking the road, we will get there just fine.

He said, "Sir, in this crazy road, which is my daily life, **I have learned that I cannot count on anyone else or anything else to be predictable. Because each road has a surprise.** Either a cow comes out of nowhere, another car races to pass, a child’s ball enters the road, a scooter or a rickshaw comes out of nowhere, with a total surprise. **The only thing I can do is be prepared and think of only my car and the passengers in my car. So the person driving next to me has to take precaution as he needs to, and I should do the same for myself and my passengers only. I can only control my own driving."**

Being a passenger in that car made me realize that he was absolutely right. **We don’t control what we encounter on the road. We only control how we steer our way forward.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 2 - SEARCHING FOR GOD AT FIVE THOUSAND FEET

> *LET GO OF PLANS GONE WRONG. THINGS HAVE A WAY OF WORKING OUT IN THE END.*

Life has a way of constantly shuffling things around, shaking our understanding of what's possible and what's not. **And somehow, in some cosmically unpredictable way, life unfolds and things work out - never as expected, but sometimes even better.**

Accept maybe's.

“Let it go. Just let it go. It happens. Stop trying to figure out why. Let go. Now, come on. Let’s go and see if the airline can do something for us. Let’s try.”

This was a start. But my mom persisted.  
“We have no money to buy tickets for the train,” she said. “Could you kindly find a way to refund us the money from the flights so that we can buy the train tickets?”  
“I’m sorry, but I cannot do that until your flight is officially canceled. Right now, the status is officially delayed, due to fog in Delhi.”  
“Please. See if you can do something. Please, sir. We need to get home,” my mom insisted. She pressed on with sincerity, persuasive enough to warrant the man having a conversation with his manager.  
After speaking to his manager, the young man came back and brought us something we never thought we’d see: money! He gave us a refund and said with a smile, “Good luck.”

First class? I thought. Whatever. It really doesn’t matter, as long as it takes me home.  
> **It’s funny how the imperfections don’t bother you so much as long as you feel like you’re headed in the right direction.**

Feeling the steel of the rails underneath, I started to realize that what I was searching for on the top of that mountain actually already resides deep inside all of us. It is this force, an innate strength that has guided us through history. **It is an unshakeable urge to give the body motion, an ability to keep walking, to keep trying, and to continue moving forward despite not knowing what will happen.** What I had missed seeing and feeling five thousand feet above, in my search for the **presence of God, I discovered only when I was forced to let go of the plans I had made, when I stopped trying to understand why things went wrong and simply accepted it. Instead, I found that presence hidden inside the generosity and kindness of those who notice our effort and help us on our journey, in the luck and randomness of things all around, and in the encouraging, action-oriented spirit that propelled my mom to let go of overthinking, to accept, to have faith, to believe, and to just keep moving forward.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 3 - TWO GUYS HOLDING HANDS

> *YOU ARE NEVER ALONE.*

We have created walls around us that prevent us from bonding with others, even while we create online virtual timelines of our lives for the world to see. But we’re so lonely. We’re terrified of the uncertainty around and in front of us. Isolated in a hyperconnected virtual world, we lack **the most important benefit of society: face-to-face social connections that help keep us going.**

> A big part of acceptance is accepting other people as they are. This is the joy of social connections: if we stop trying to fix one another, control one another, or judge one another, we can begin to lift each other up. We just have to accept the person we get, not the person we want.

It’s not perfect or ideal, but those human connections and deep relationships keep Indians going forward, despite living in an unpredictable environment where nothing is certain. The tribal fires around which comforting words of wisdom were dispensed by village elders years ago have become the societal norms of neighbors popping in from time to time, friends meeting friends at tiny celebrations, parents’ dinner-table advice to the adult sons and daughters who live with them, and sometimes even through the simple gesture of two guys holding hands, which I had the almost awkward pleasure of experiencing.

That day, I learned that it is a societal norm to demonstrate your love, care, and affection for another man, not through hugs or fist bumps but often by simply holding hands. 

> **More importantly, I learned that people in India aren’t afraid to share their affection, worries, fears, hopes, or dreams with one another. The social bonds that we build and cultivate, even through simple gestures, are crucial to helping us get through some of the most trying times of our lives. It gives us strength and motivates us to move forward. So it’s OK to be pushed outside of your comfort zone and to accept someone else’s unique way of showing caring and affection.** Really, when you think about it, isn’t it a little silly to be stressed out by someone who wants to hold your hand?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 2 - DON'T OVERTHINK

> *DON'T OVERANALYZE. DON'T OVERPLAN. DON'T TRY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE.*

**Things change constantly.** It’s fine to think about pros and cons and the consequences of our actions, but too often our minds try to get perfect certainty, and sometimes we get lost in the process.

Let’s stop overthinking what other people do, think, or say. Let’s realize that love, career, business, the economy, or our future are not predictable. Let’s redirect those thoughts toward working on our purpose, our passion, our love, our family, our friends, and our work. **Let’s rechannel all that overthinking and worrying about tomorrow toward the most certain thing we have in life: our own actions today.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 4 - HOW TO CHOOSE A SPOUSE IN AN HOUR

> *YOU CAN ADAPT TO ANYTHING - YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET.*

"Well, he came over my house to meet my parents, and that was it. They liked him and we decided to get married. But I kind of knew on our first date," she said confidently.

"But help me understand something. How did you know he’s the one?" asked, almost teasingly.

"Just because you don’t have a negative vibe when you’re on a date or a lunch, it doesn’t mean that you won’t ever fight or argue in the future or have difficult times in your marriage. Because I understand that life is never easy."

**"There are always compromises in any relationships," she continued.**

**"But you know what? We’ll make it work. We will figure it out. We’ll learn as we go. We’ll make it work!"**

There is no special knowledge that surrounds the decision of a young woman to go forward with a lifelong decision to marry a man she has met for only an hour or so. Whether Garima’s marriage will work out cannot be known for certain. What is important, however, is her strong belief in the ability to make it work, a belief that comes from an acceptance that life has its ups and downs and that there is no perfect life, person, relationship, or marriage. Instead of certainty, Garima has steadfast faith in her own ability to figure it out as she goes. She has faith in her ability—in their ability—to be fluid, flexible, and agile as life unfolds; to improvise; to be secure in an insecure world, armed with only the knowledge that resilience exists within. And part of this is due to Garima’s ability to not overthink.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 5 - CELEBRATING A BIRTHDAY WITH NOTHING BUT A BOLLYWOOD SONG

> *YOU ALREADY HAVE THE IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE.*

Casually rubbing the remnants of his lost index finger, Rakesh eased further into his chair, beaming his smile as he looked around the room. Full of happiness, joy, and cake, his family celebrated, joking around with one another, laughing at little things, dancing. My wife and daughter joined the dance in the middle of the tiny room, lit up by the family’s smiles. Rakesh paused and looked back at me, not with the eyes of a desperate man who was unsure where his next meal was coming from but with the
eyes of one who was at peace despite the problems at his doorstep. With a deep smile, he said, "Thanks, but this is all I really need. Isn’t it?"

I was well aware that he was still struggling financially, but that was OK for him because he had something more important.

**My cousin was truly living his life, despite the seemingly overwhelming challenges he faced each day. He moved forward with nothing more than the family that surrounded him, affection, and the occasional celebration. They put food on the handful of plates they owned and got through it with an attitude that was hopeful and carefree. I realized that moments of joy are not necessarily found in the crockery surrounding the cake but in the tiny celebrations of life with family, friends, and a Bollywood song.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 6 - MISSING THE DANCE AT AN INDIAN WEDDING

> *WORRYING ABOUT WHAT'S COMING NEXT WILL MAKE YOU MISS THE BEST TIMES OF YOUR LIFE.*

It went by so fast, I thought. My heart felt as though I had unfinished business. I wanted to celebrate, to dance. But it was all out of order. You’re supposed to dance after they get married, not before. That was it. They got it wrong. It’s all upside down here. How are you supposed to celebrate something that hasn’t finished yet?
As we were leaving the hotel to go back to the house, exhausted, I glanced over at the still-burning fire, and suddenly **I realized that they had not gotten it wrong. I had gotten it wrong. I was so focused on the destination that I forgot to enjoy the ride. I was worried about the wrong things. My mind had been so busy focusing on my way of thinking about how things ought to be that I didn’t enjoy how things really were.** I was so worried about getting to the wedding on time and what was coming next that I didn’t fully enjoy the experience of the horse, the cocktails by the side of the road, dancing with my beautiful, joyful wife, the rituals and customs and their deep meaning.

**I didn’t appreciate the ride, but ultimately it all ends the same way: two people get married. They get married, and everything works out in the end. My overthinking mind had made me miss possibly some of the best moments of my life. This was my wife’s only brother, and I had missed out on dancing at his wedding.**

**Perhaps sensing my disappointment and regret, my wife gave my arm a little squeeze. "Don’t worry, honey," the flight attendant added. "There’s always an Indian wedding happening somewhere in the world."**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 7 - LEARNING TO MEDITATE AMID CHAOS

> *DAILY RITUALS SERVE TO REMIND US TO START PARTICIPATING IN LIFE.*

For many Indians, the day’s travels will also take them to an Indian temple. Indians do not banish chaos at the doors of most holy places — actually, in a sense, they expect it. There is so much confusion at an Indian temple. So many gods. So many people doing different things. Take off your shoes. Wash your hands. Ring the bell. Spill this water over this particular statue. Put a flower on the feet of that statue. The divine fragrance of incense intoxicates the mind while the ears take in the sounds of a schoolgirl’s whispered prayers and the ringing bells indicating that another worshipper has entered in search of solace.

Bells, incense—it’s all so much, so confusing. There’s so much noise that you can’t meditate. You can’t think straight. All the random thoughts about tomorrow that you entered with are drowned out by the noise, the smells, and the visual assortment. So many senses are being evoked that there’s no room for contemplative prayer. Even the pandits don’t give you time to think. Instead, they make you move. **Amid all the confusion and these complicated methods of reaching God, however, you are forced to stop thinking about the bills, the problems at work, or the uncertain future that is yet to materialize. Instead, you are encouraged to start participating.** You move your hands, sing, say verses in ancient Sanskrit, which you don’t understand. Move your feet. Ring a bell. Throw flowers. Pour milk. Fold your hands. Say "Om."

**You can’t think. You *do*. And that’s the point. It’s moving meditation.**

I’ve realized that Indian temples are not there to provide the teachings of God so that you have the answers to all the questions in your life. They serve a more practical purpose, as a reminder that, just as your heart is moving and brings life beat by beat, **you are living by actively doing. Living in the present moment is the path to the divinity all around you. While you are pursuing, chasing, walking, running, breathing, working, and engaging, you have a life worth living, right here and right now.**

**Going through the motions forced upon me by the pandit had made my mind stop overthinking about the future and had helped to kick-start movement in my feet, turning it into motion and ultimately momentum.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 8 - HITCHHIKING TO WORK IN MUMBAI

> *FOCUSING ON YOUR OWN ACTIONS MOVES YOU THROUGH THE DISTRACTIONS.*

"Do you know any of the competitor reps?" I asked. "Or how they’re promoting their products? Or how they’re positioning your product?"

"Not really," he answered.

"Don’t you want to be prepared and understand how to promote against them?"

**"Why bother about them when I can do nothing about them and they change so frequently?"** he answered, almost philosophically.

**"I don’t worry about them because that serves no purpose. Rather, it is better to fix yourself and your mind than to try to understand other people. You can get lost in trying to think about what others say, think, or do."**

He started to paint the colors around his story and it began to become clearer. **A few years before, Tushar had been a very anxious and stressed-out person.** He was a type A personality who used to plan, prepare, and execute. He was highly trained, motivated, and intent on high performance. He did what he was told to do—precall analysis, postcall analysis, paperwork, expense reports, sales reports, and the rest. But the stress was hurting him. He was overloaded by more information, more competitors to track, more complexity in trying to figure out his customers, increasing unpredictability in a growing but fragile economy, and he became overwhelmed, angry, and frustrated. He didn’t know what to do because there was so much coming at him so fast.

Then the monsoon came. It was a year of severe flooding like no other year in the streets of Mumbai. On his way home to his humble apartment he saw many people made homeless by the monsoon, and he made up his mind to do something to help them. Tushar and his wife took all the food out of their meager cupboard and put it into a bag. **Then they carried it to the nearest makeshift tent where some of the homeless were living and gave it all away. That night, he told me, he carried home a joy he hadn’t felt in years. He suggested to his wife that they ought to do more of that, because it was so important to help others, and she mentioned a guru from her home city of Chennai who spoke fervently about giving to others as a way of gaining salvation for the soul.** Skeptical but a little curious, Tushar went to see the
guru speak. He was sold.

**And so began Tushar’s transformation from what he described as a stressed person, overthinking about others, *to a more serene man who now knew where to focus.***

**"I started to realize that what I was trying to do was to *force* things around me to change. Very easily, I would get so upset at what other people would say or do. *But my guru taught me to mind my own business. To let things be as they are and not worry about what others do but to mind what I do. To concentrate all my efforts on improving myself.*"**

"Before, when a street beggar would ask me for money, I would say no because I knew that he might not use that money for food but instead waste it on alcohol or drugs. But my guru said, **'That’s not your concern. You take the action that you take without minding what the beggar does. Don’t have opinions of others. Don’t let the opinions of others affect you. Just let all opinions be still. Let the thoughts and actions of others be still.' I became happier the moment I stopped putting my attention on others. Now I don’t worry about trying to understand others or try to change others. What I work on changing is me."**

In the process of reordering his own thinking, **Tushar also had realized that *he was better off directing his thoughts at himself and focusing his actions toward serving others rather than spending energy on all the distractions of life.***

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 9 - LEARNING TO CATCH THE BUS

> *WAITING FOR PERFECTION WILL GET YOU NOWHERE.*

**Waiting for perfection gets us nowhere, and it only breeds more worry, anxiety, and stress, *because we are waiting for something that does not exist.* There is no perfect job, no perfect partner, no perfect career, and no perfect moment. There are only people, jobs, and moments. And if we try to force our "ideal" situation on life, we’ll be waiting, stressed and worried, for a long time. But *that time never comes, and we waste all those moments.***

"Enough is enough," I said to myself as the third bus approached. "I’m done waiting."

**I broke free from that nagging voice of self-doubt the moment I put one foot forward to start the run. It really didn’t matter if the bus was full or not; I was determined to get on it.**

Once again, lots of people crowded the spot where the door was supposed to be. I ran for it and found a spot on the pole where I could get a sturdy hold. **I almost slipped, but then I felt a couple of hands reaching to help me.** I set my footing and got a position on the pole full of hands. Just as I was about to smile and celebrate my success, I noticed the man standing next to me in the doorway. **He released one of his hands to reach out and help a guy running behind get on the bus. After that man was securely on, he in turn reached out and helped someone else get on.**

Firmly gripping the pole on that overcrowded bus, **I realized I had silenced the voice of self-doubt in my head.** It was such an incredibly
uplifting feeling. I wanted more. **My cousin had also gotten on the bus, after making sure I got on securely.** Smiling at me and giving a thumbs-up, he went into the sardine can and signaled me to do the same. I managed to squeeze my way through and we stood somewhere in the middle, standing shoulder to shoulder with countless others. I was smiling quietly, celebrating the tiny success of jumping aboard.

**The real beauty of that bus ride was a joy that I was headed somewhere ... anywhere. I was not waiting anymore and thinking about taking action; I had actually taken action.**

**I also was *liberated from thoughts about the way things ought to be and had embraced things as they were*. There is *real joy and freedom in seeing something coming and, no matter how imperfect it seems, reaching out to take action, and in having some assurance that, once we do start running and grab on tight, helping hands will often help those who help themselves*.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 10 - SHE'S WAITING FOR ME TOMORROW

> *SERVING A PURPOSE OR A PERSON HELPS TO PULL YOU FORWARD.*

**But deep inside all of us lies a clue that can help us move forward through the chaos. It is a deep desire to be relevant, to be significant to someone or something greater than ourselves. With so much noise in our jobs and our daily lives, so much uncertainty in the world, we can lose sight of something that gives us joy and happiness and that *propels us forward: the ability to do something that has real meaning for someone else*.**

"So, why do you do it, Prakash?" I was trying to get to the heart of his motivation, to discover what made him get up in the morning. "Help me understand. **You don’t have a secure job. You’re not a doctor. You cannot solve all these villagers’ problems. You work in some of the worst conditions, with no toilets, no resources, and no way of knowing if you’ll have a job next month. Why do you do it?"**

Prakash said, "That woman with high blood pressure is waiting for me tomorrow. I must see how she’s doing. She’s waiting for me."

This time, finally, I understood. **Prakash continues to serve, despite difficult circumstances, because he is compelled by a duty higher than himself. This duty doesn’t push him ahead; it actually pulls him forward by the strings of his heart. He is able to get through the challenges he confronts each day because he hopes to affect just one human life.** 

**He has no grandiose visions of a greater purpose, doesn’t know what the future will hold for him, but his daily actions are brought into focus by the belief that someone might benefit, ever so slightly, from his effort, his work, his life. He is compelled to rise each morning, despite tremendous problems, because someone needs him. That woman needs him. She is waiting for him.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 11 - LEARNING TO EMBRACE THE CHAOS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE

> *YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE IN A STRAIGHT LINE.*

I recently learned a lesson, not in India but at my dad’s kitchen table: the
most fundamental principle governing our existence is that we are born by
sheer luck, randomness, and chance. We didn’t get here in a straight line
and we’re not going to move forward in a straight line.
We have been living in the fabric of chaos all our lives, without realizing
it. Chaos determines our birth; our meeting of friends, partners, and
colleagues; and some of life’s greatest experiences. Why are we fighting it?
Why are we stressing out trying to control something that has brought us
into this world and has introduced us to the people we love?

"My problem is that I am trying to figure out how to go ahead with a life and career decision. It feels like I’m taking a big chance and I’m not sure if I should do it or not. **I’m trying to cover all the angles and figure out how things will turn out.**"

Without even asking me the topic of my great introspection, he smiled and said, **"You know, every day I get up and give thanks for the chance I’ve been given in my life, where I came from and where we are now, having the Dairy Queen store where your mom and I love going to work every single day. We are really very lucky. What are you so afraid of?** Look at how I happened to find myself, out of all places, in that town, where I met your mom and we got married.

**"Don’t you get it? You were born by chance. And you have been living in a world full of chance. Why are you so afraid of something that brought you into this world in the first place?"**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 12 - MEETING THE GURU

> *YOU CAN ANSWER ALL YOUR OWN QUESTIONS.*

**If we only stop and listen to our own inner voice, we can find all the answers we seek and move forward in the direction we really want to go in life.**

"But let me ask you something. When you pray to God and ask Him all these questions—What should I do with my life? How do I earn more money? Whom shall I marry? How do I get through these difficult times?—does He respond? Does He answer you?"

"No, God doesn’t answer."

"Right. **God doesn’t answer your questions because He is allowing you the time to answer your own question. You see, most people expect the answer to their life questions to be somewhere outside of themselves. But the reality is that God is allowing them that silence, that time, so that they can answer the questions themselves. Because the answer to all of your questions, the answer to which path to take forward, is always inside of you. It is not with-out but with-in.**

Sensing that I still didn’t have the answer to my question about how to choose a path, he touched my hand. Giggling slightly, he said, "You know, some people think that I am here to give them answers to the questions they have, but my role is to be the stubborn person by your side, to help you ask yourself the right question."

**In our search for fulfillment, happiness, and direction during times of great confusion, we don’t need to look in some faraway place like a village in the hills of India. Rather, we should look in a place that is so near but so often overlooked: within.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Epilogue: The Butterfly Effect

**When we see ourselves as more than human and feebly attempt to make predictions, to cast aspersions, to scheme and overplan, we get stuck, because chaos spares no one. We can begin to realize our fullest potential for a fulfilling and happy life by learning to let go of our ego’s attempt at control, by accepting the unpredictable nature of life. We must stop overthinking, overanalyzing, and trying to predict, and simply move forward.** 

**Chaos never goes away. You learn to live with it, at times flourishing in it but mostly just learning to embrace the chaos.**

A butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause unpredictable, unanticipated consequences, such as a tornado in a faraway place like Texas. The butterfly effect posits that, in a complex, fast, interconnected system with lots of little actions performed by billions of actors, one tiny action can lead to a major, unpredictable shift.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## EMBRACE THE CHAOS MANIFESTO
