Author: Deepak Chopra

| Om _ Namah | Law of             | Applying the Law                                           |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Bhavam     | Pure Potentiality  | Sit alone in silent meditation twice a day for 30 minutes each in the morning and evening, to just be. Take time everyday to commune with nature and to silently witness the intelligence within every living thing. Judge nothing that occurs. |
| Vardhanam  | Giving             | Give something to everyone I come in contact with. (Most of the time, this is going to be something good and non-material. Eg. words, knowledge, help, care, affection, love and appreciation, unless what they really need is material). Be open to receiving and gratefully receive from others. (But do not expect, I guess.) |
| Kriyam     | Karma              | **The best way to prepare for any moment in the future is to be fully conscious in the present.** Witness the choices I make to bring them to my conscious awareness. Make choices that will bring fulfillment and happiness to me and others. Consult the heart while making the choices. |
| Daksham    | Least Effort       | Accept, take responsibility, remain in defenselessness. Accept people, situations, and events as they occur. Take responsibility for your situation and for all events seen as problems. Relinquish the need to defend your point of view. |
| Ritam      | Intention & Desire | Make a list of all my deepest, most cherished intentions and desires and look at it in the morning, evening and night. The God in me will fulfill my desires. Trust that when things donâ€™t seem to go your way, there is a reason. Inherent in every intention and desire is the mechanics for its fulfillment. Accept the present as it is, and manifest the future through my deepest, most cherished intentions and desires. |
| Anandham   | Detachment         | Allow myself and those around me the freedom to be as they are. Participate in everything with detached involvement. Accept uncertainty. Solutions will emerge. It is the path to my freedom. Be open to all possibilities and choices. [It works!](https://koushikvikram.github.io/self-improvement/it-works/) |
| Varunam    | Dharma             | Nurture the God in me, which is the deep stillness within my heart. Make a list of my unique talents and the things I love to do while expressing my unique talents. Ask myself, "How can I serve?", "How can I help?" and express my unique talents with love in the service of everyone and everything. |
