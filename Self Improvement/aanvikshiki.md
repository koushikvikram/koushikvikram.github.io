# [Inside Chanakya's Mind - Aanvikshiki and The Art of Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34388246-inside-chanakya-s-mind)

Author: Radhakrishnan Pillai

## Introduction

Imagine if I were taught how to think from the moment my thinking faculties develop:
- analysis
- decision-making
- prioritizing
- planning
- structuring
- critical evaluation
- logic 

I would 
- question when questions are required
- accept others' views where it is necessary
- think through all the consequences
- take calculated risks 
- be far more successful at every stage of my life

> ***Thinking can be taught.***

The first step in knowledge creation is research, and it is this research that leads to development.

Originality does not come because one starts from zero. Originality comes from going into the depths of any subject and uncovering new insights.

Aanvikshiki is the process of enquiring and right thinking, or the science of thinking.

Chanakya wants his students to study aanvikshiki as their first subject. He wanted his students to be leaders. And the first quality of leadership is to think correctly and clearly. From such clarity comes good decision-making capacity. And sound decisions have an impact on everyone.

These are the sciences (vidya) that are fundamental to becoming a good leader
- Right thinking (aanvikshiki)
- The three Vedas (trai)
- Economics (vaarta) 
- The science of politics (dandaniti)

Practising aanvikshiki requires one to consider three things:
1. Good and evil (according to Vedic tradition—trai)
2. Material gain or loss (according to economics—vaarta)
3. Good policy and bad policy (according to the science of politics—
dandaniti)

Additionally, it includes the consideration of the relative strength and weakness of the three sciences mentioned (trai, vaarta and dandaniti).

So, while thinking about something, we need to carefully measure its pros and cons. Is it spiritually good? Will it give any material gain? Is it the right policy decision?

Thus, when we consider various dimensions, we will be able to take the right and correct decision, weighing all the consequences.

> ***Having a balanced mind and keeping ourselves calm and composed in all circumstances is the reward that aanvikshiki brings to a person***.

It brings about proficiency in
1. Thought—it gives clear thinking (clairvoyance)
2. Speech—verbal communication
3. Action—there is perfection in all activities

> ***Aanvikshiki is ever thought of as the lamp of all sciences, as the means of all actions and as the support of all laws and duties.***
