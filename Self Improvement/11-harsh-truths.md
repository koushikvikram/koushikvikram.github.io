1. You'll only see your loved ones a few more times (like 15 times in your entire life) if you're physically far away from them.
2. Your real friends are the ones who are there for you when you have *nothing* to offer in return. Cherish them.
3. Money is correlated with happiness up to a baseline level—that level is lower than you think. Beyond it, there are diminishing returns to more money. Prioritize internal happiness.
4. Failure doesn't always lead to growth. Sometimes failure just leads to pain. When you're in pain, find a friend to lean on. When someone else is in pain, be that friend.
5. You'll literally never know what you want to be when you grow up. Most hyper-successful people still have no idea what they want to do. They just have a bias for action that has allowed them to capitalize on opportunities and compound effectively over time. If you have a bias for action, you'll always be fine.
6. Most people don't really care about you. It's pretty liberating to realize that, for the most part, everyone is really just going through life worried about themselves. Be yourself and live life according to your values.
7. You probably won't be remembered or have a legacy. I've chosen to chase something else—the lives I can impact today, the happiness I can create in those around me.
8. The timelines we create for ourselves are mostly just arbitrary nonsense. Be curious and spend time with great people. The rest will take care of itself.
9. There's no such thing as a hack. The only hack is painful, relentless consistency. It’s not sexy, but it works.
10. Hard work and consistency isn't always enough. Do your best, but don't assume it's always going to be enough. If you lose, it better be that the person is simply more talented than you. Never beat yourself.
11. The world is definitively not fair, but it will always belong to those who make the most of what they have before them. The Internet and access to technology is opening up the world.
