Don't read textbooks linearly like I read novels.

> *Repetition is the mother of learning.*

Steps (1-4 creates a map of the chapter, 5 helps connect the dots in the mental map)
1. **Flip through each page**
    - look at the pictures
    - see what the pages look like
    - get a sense of how long the chapter is
    - how much of it is words compared to pictures/graphs
    - does anything jump out to me?
2. **Look at the summary/quiz at end of the chapter**
    - helps understand what's most important in the chapter
3. **Read the bold print in the chapter**
    - bold is the stuff they want me to see
4. **Read the first and last sentence of each paragraph**
    - first sentence is the introduction
    - last sentence sums up the paragraph
5. **Read the chapter and take notes**
