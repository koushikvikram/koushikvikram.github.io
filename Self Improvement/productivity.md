# Productivity - Sam Altman

Source: [Productivity - Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)

Compound growth gets discussed as a financial concept, but it works in careers as well, and it is magic. A small productivity gain, compounded over 50 years, is worth a lot.

1. What I Work On
- Picking the right thing to work on is the most important element of productivity
- Develop the confidence to stick with my convictions
- Leave enough time in my schedule to think about what to work on
- I've learned that I can't be very productive working on things I don't care about or don't like.  - So I just try not to put myself in a position where I have to do them (by delegating, avoiding, or something else)
- Stuff that I don’t like is a painful drag on morale and momentum
- Delegation: remember that everyone else is also most productive when they’re doing what they like, and do what I'd want other people to do for me — try to figure out who likes (and is good at) doing what, and delegate that way
- It’s important to learn that I can learn anything I want, and that I can get better quickly
- Doing great work usually requires colleagues of some sort. Try to be around smart, productive, happy, and positive people that don't belittle my ambitions.
- Both pick the right problem and do the work
- Work both smart and hard
2. Prioritization
- Three key pillars
    - Make sure to get the important things done
    - Don't waste time on stupid things
    - Make a lot of lists
- Make lists of what I want to accomplish each year, each month, and each day
- Prefer lists written down on paper
- Re-transcribe lists frequently
- Try to prioritize in a way that generates momentum.  The more I get done, the better I feel, and then the more I get done.  I like to start and end each day with something I can really make progress on.
- I am relentless about getting my most important projects done—I’ve found that if I really want something to happen and I push hard enough, it usually happens. 
- I try to be ruthless about saying no to stuff, and doing non-critical things in the quickest way possible.
- I generally try to avoid meetings and conferences as I find the time cost to be huge.
- However, it is critical that I keep enough space in my schedule to allow for chance encounters and exposure to new people and ideas. Having an open network is valuable.
- Have different times of the day to use for different kinds of work
- Value my time
- Chasing productivity for its own sake isn't helpful
- The right goal is to allocate my year optimally, not my day.
3. Physical Factors
- Experiment to find out what works best for my body
- Sleep, excercise and nutrition
4. Other Stuff
- Don’t neglect family and friends for the sake of productivity — that’s a very stupid tradeoff (and very likely a net productivity loss, because I'll be less happy). Don’t neglect doing things I love or that clear my head either.
