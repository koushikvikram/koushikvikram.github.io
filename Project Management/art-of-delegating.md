# Work Less, Create More Value - The Art of Delegating

Source: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2012/11/29/work-less-create-more-value](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2012/11/29/work-less-create-more-value)

# scope = f(resources, time)

Step one is **figuring out which activities are actually valued by the end customer**. Take into account stakeholders' concerns and requirements along the way, but if I'm not **defining true value in the end customer/patient/consumer's eyes**, I'm looking through the wrong lens.

Say "no" to some of the less important items and non-value-adding steps. Working harder is often counter-productive. Don't strive to "get it done" at any cost, not realizing the **true cost is the diminished effort against other, higher value adding activities.**

> My options for completing tasks (in descending order of task value):
> 1. **Do myself**
>    - **Well** (for things our end customer values most)
>    - **Just well enough** (for things valuable to our end customer, but not as important as some others)
> 2. **Delegate** and 
>    - supervise (**Manage**) (for things important, but doesn't have enough value in doing them myself or can be done better by someone else)
>    - trust (**Lead**) (for things I want off my plate)
> 3. Do **later** (for things that are not pressing, but are somewhat important and eventually may need to be done)
> 4. Do **never** (for things that are bad ideas and will be of no good even to people I delegate to. My clearest "no."  Not me. Not others. Not anyone. Now now. Not ever. Go away. Harsh, but clear.)


## 1. Do Myself Well

I'm going to say no and downplay, delegate, cut back, and avoid other things so I can spend more time on these few, most critical activities. This is where my team and I need to **strive for perfection**. Doing well is an understatement. Here's where it's **essential to do my absolute best**.

## 2. Do myself, but just well enough

I accept the need to do these things myself. But they are not as important as some others. I should **do them well enough to satisfy the stakeholders** that need them to fit into what they are doing **for the end customer â€“ and no better**.

## 3. Delegate and supervise (Manage)

These are important items that I want to be done well, but there isn't enough value in doing them myself or maybe there's someone else who can do the work better than me.

## 4. Delegate and trust (Lead)

These items are off my plate. I trust the people I delegate to, to do or manage them well. Inspire and enable, never undercutting the authority I've delegated.  
They need 
- authority
- resources
- accountability

## 5. Do later

Things I decide to do later may get done eventually, but certainly not now. Delaying them may cause stress with the people who need them now. That's a choice I've made in pursuit of the highest value adding activities for the end customer.

## 6. Do never

Not only do I think these tasks are bad ideas for me and for people I might delegate to, but I also believe they are just bad ideas.

> ***Any time a task arises, ask myself about the end value and then determine the best approach.*** 

That will vary with my level in the organization. The more senior I am in the organization and the more people I have to manage or lead, the fewer things I will actually do myself well.

> Leverages:
> - As a **"do'er"**, I'm trying to figure out which tasks I must **do well, less well versus which things I can do later or never**.
> - As a **manager**, my greatest leverage is in the **tasks I can delegate and manage**. This is how I free up time to spend my own time on the things I must do myself well.
> - As a **senior leader**, my greatest leverage is in the **tasks, projects, programs and priorities I can delegate and trust**. I want to spend ever more time **inspiring and enabling, leveraging purpose, frameworks and incentives.**
