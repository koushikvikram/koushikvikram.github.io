| Singapore's Disadvantages             | Singapore's Advantage |
|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| Small population                      | Location at the heart of the trade route that connected Asia and Europe |
| Small land area                       |                       |
| No natural resources like coal or oil |                       |

Despite these disadvantages, in just 35 years, Singapore went from being a slum to one of the richest countries in the world.

## The Fall of Singapore

In the 1930's, Singapore had been a British colony for 100 years and was prosperous. However, during the 2nd world war, Japan captured Singapore and in 3 years, it committed mass killings, destroyed all infrastructure including the harbors, electricity, water and telephone lines and left the island in complete ruin, leading to a massive shortage in food.

Britain won back Singapore in 1945, but Singaporeans had lost faith in the British. At the same time, the British started decolonizing Asia as business was no longer viable in Asia.

Instead of leaving Singapore straight away, Britain held the first general election in 1959.

## Enter Lee Kuan Yew (LKY)

The then 31 year old Lee Kuan Yew created the People's Action Party and contested and won the election.

LKY saw a new ray of hope in the form of Malaysia, which had much more resources than Singapore.

Malaysia accepted Singapore's request for help and admitted it into Malaysia's federation.

This was done with the hope that
| Singapore will                               | Malaysia will                                    |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| Be able to create more jobs                  | Have access to the Singapore port                |
| Have access to the free market in Malaysia   | Be able to collect taxes from Singapore          |

## 1965 - When it rains, it pours

As things started falling in place for Singapore, Malaysia started 
- exploiting Singapore by charging them 39.8% taxes even though it had just 17% of the total population
- discriminating against non-Malay population (Indians, Chinese and other minorities), which led to a series of communal riots and massacres.

Eventually, in 1965, Malaysia kicked Singapore out of their country, which led to an economic disaster again because
- for more than 100 years, the Singapore economy was intertwined with Malaysia such that commodities were produced in Malaysia and sold from Singapore
- but within a fortnight, all of Singapore's warehouses were left empty

At the same time, the British Army, which was Singapore's largest employer was suddenly preparing to leave the country.

Now, Singapore was facing multiple (10) problems including
- No protection from the British Army
- Peak unemployment
- 20% of Singapore's GDP vanishing
- Economic Crisis
- No vast lands
- Very few factories
- Communal violence
- Small population
- No natural resources
- No industries
