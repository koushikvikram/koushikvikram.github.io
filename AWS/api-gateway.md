# API Gateway

- https://www.alexdebrie.com/posts/api-gateway-access-logs/

## POST Requests

POST requests have no restriction on data length, so theyâ€™re more suitable for files and images. Whereas GET requests have a limit of 2 kilobytes (some servers can handle 64 KB data) and GET only allows ASCII values.
