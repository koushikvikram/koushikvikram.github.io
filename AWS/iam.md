# Identity and Access Management

## Introduction

IAM allows us to provide ***Cloud Security*** by managing 
- who can access our resources
- what they can do once they have access

Authentication vs Authorization
- Authentication: The process that proves **who** we are
- Authorization: Defines **what** we can do

Security Credentials
- Username and password
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Access Keys (often used by developers for application code)
