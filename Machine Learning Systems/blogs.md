## Data is the core of any data infrastructure

Daily reminder that despite the amazing technology in the Modern Data Stack, the core of any data infrastructure is the data itself. If that data has no connection to business value, is devoid of context, has no clear producer/owner, is poorly designed, and can't play nicely with other semantic concepts, all the money in the world won't turn your 'stack' from a cost center to a value add.

Be careful not to over-optimize for 'second order' data impacts. Yes, being able to pull massive amounts of data in batch/real-time is very cool. Yes, monitoring is awesome and useful. Yes, it's true that excellent BI is incredibly important. But please remember that some of the most valuable data infrastructures in the world (orders of magnitude more valuable than most modern data set-ups today) were built without ANY of these modern technologies.

**With a solid foundation of well-designed data that maps back to real-world meaning then the Modern Data Stack is an incredible addition to any data team's infrastructure.** But without it, organizations are layering complexity on top of a ruined foundation - marred by spiraling tech debt. Always prioritize the data first.

## You should write online every single day.

You should write online every single day.

Here's what will happen:
- Some people will love it.
- Some people will hate it.
- Many people will ignore it.

It doesn't matter.

Writing is a critical piece of personal growth

If you want to start writing, here are 3 things that work for me:

1. Build something
    - Anything. A website. A newsletter. An app. A course. An eBook. A marketplace. A car.
    - Then, write about the ups and downs.
    - Publish it.
2. Journal for 15 minutes at the end of each day.
    - What did you learn that day? Brain dump it.
    - Cut out all the fluff. Make it easy to digest.
    - Post it.
3. Reframe interesting articles
    - Schedule time each week to review saved articles.
    - Pull out the most interesting thing you read. Write your perspective on it.
    - Add your flair + send it.

Or do none of these things and try something else, because what works for me may not work for you.

But if you're trying, at least you're starting.

Try today.

It's a muscle you'll never regret building.

## David Ogilvy 10 Tips on Writing

The better you write, the higher you go in Ogilvy & Mather. People who think well, write well.

Woolly minded people write woolly memos, woolly letters and woolly speeches.

Good writing is not a natural gift. You have to learn to write well. Here are 10 hints:

1. Read the [Roman-Raphaelson book on writing](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1538252.Writing_That_Works). Read it three times.
2. Write the way you talk. Naturally.
3. Use short words, short sentences and short paragraphs.
4. Never use jargon words like reconceptualize, demassification, attitudinally, judgmentally. They are hallmarks of a pretentious ass.
5. Never write more than two pages on any subject.
6. Check your quotations.
7. Never send a letter or a memo on the day you write it. Read it aloud the next morning—and then edit it.
8. If it is something important, get a colleague to improve it.
9. Before you send your letter or your memo, make sure it is crystal clear what you want the recipient to do.
10. If you want ACTION, don’t write. Go and tell the guy what you want.
