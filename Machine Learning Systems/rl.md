# Reinforcement Learning


## Getting Started
- [How to get started with Reinforcement Learning](https://gordicaleksa.medium.com/how-to-get-started-with-reinforcement-learning-rl-4922fafeaf8c)

## General Resources

Source: [General resources on reinforcement learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/reinforcementlearning/comments/embtnp/reinforcement_learning_book_for_beginners/fdnl09t/)

- [Spinning Up in RL!](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) - created by OpenAI to serve as introduction to modern Deep RL, I would start here.
- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) - is the introductory book on RL. It covers very basics and build up from there. Does not cover deep RL.
- [David Silver Reinforcement Learning Course (2016)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbWDNovNB5mqFBgq7i3MY6Ui4zudcvNFJ) - video lectures aligned with book above. Very well explained, covers basics and some modern deep rl methods. Very fun to watch IMHO.
- [Advanced Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOh7QUZGyiU&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDNJre23vqCGIVpfZ_K2RZs&ab_channel=DeepMind) - updated version of the above, more slower paced, but some things are better explained in 2016 version IMHO.
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06339) - 2018 paper by Yuxi Li is a recent(ish) survey and overview of the field.
