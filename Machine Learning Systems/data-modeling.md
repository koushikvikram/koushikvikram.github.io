# Data Modeling

## Star Schema
```
The star schema separates business process data into 
- facts, which hold the measurable, quantitative data about a business
- dimensions, which are descriptive attributes related to fact data

Examples of fact data include sales price, sale quantity, and time, distance, speed and weight measurements.
