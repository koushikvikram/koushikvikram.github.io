## Move files from one repository to another, preserving git history

Source: [https://medium.com/@ayushya/move-directory-from-one-repository-to-another-preserving-git-history-d210fa049d4b](https://medium.com/@ayushya/move-directory-from-one-repository-to-another-preserving-git-history-d210fa049d4b)

### Step 1: Getting files ready to move from Repository A (7 mini-steps)

Make a copy of repository A as the following steps make major changes to this copy which you should not push!

```bash
mkdir cloneA
cd cloneA
git clone --branch <branch> --origin origin --progress \
  -v <git repository A url>

# eg. git clone --branch master --origin origin --progress \
#   -v https://github.com/username/myproject.git

# (assuming myprojects is the repository you want to copy from)
```

Go to that directory.

```bash
cd <git repository A directory>

#  eg. cd myproject
# Folder Path is ~/cloneA/myproject
```

To avoid accidentally making any remote changes (eg. by pushing), delete the link to the original repository.

```bash
git remote rm origin
```

Go through your history and files, removing anything that is not in `FOLDER_TO_KEEP`. The result is the contents of `FOLDER_TO_KEEP` spewed out into the base of repository A.

```bash
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter <directory> -- --all
# eg. git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter subfolder1/subfolder2/FOLDER_TO_KEEP -- --all
```

Clean the unwanted data.

```bash
git reset --hard
git gc --aggressive 
git prune
git clean -fd
```

Move all the files and directories to a NEW_FOLDER which you want to push to repository B.

```bash
mkdir <base directory>
#eg mkdir NEW_FOLDER

mv * <base directory>
#eg mv * NEW_FOLDER
```

Alternatively, you can drag all the files and directory to the NEW_FOLDER using GUI.

Add the changes and commit them.

```bash
git add .
git commit
```

### Step 2: Merge the files into the new repository B

Make a copy of repository B if you don‚Äôt have one already.

```bash
mkdir cloneB
cd cloneB

git clone <git repository B url>
# eg. git clone 
https://github.com/username/newproject.git
```

Go to that directory.

```bash
cd <git repository B directory>
#  eg. cd newproject
# Folder Path is ~/cloneB/newproject
```

Create a remote connection to repository A as a branch in repository B.

```bash
git remote add repo-A <git repository A directory>
# (repo-A can be anything - it's just a random name)

# eg. git remote add repo-A ~/cloneA/myproject
```

Pull files and history from this branch (containing only the directory you want to move) into repository B.

```bash
git pull repo-A master --allow-unrelated-histories
# This merges master from repository A into repository B
```

Remove the remote connection to repository A.
```bash
git remote rm repo-A
```

Finally, push the changes

```bash
git push
```

You can delete both the cloned repositories.

The files changes with history are now available online in repository B.

`git pull --rebase` You don't need to know the name of your destination branch.

If your upstream branch is not set, try `git pull origin <branch> --rebase`

To set this option globally, use `git config --global pull.rebase true`

## Gitlab Issue: Time Tracking

> Aside: Quick Actions: Quick actions are text-based shortcuts for common actions that are usually done by selecting buttons or dropdowns in the GitLab user interface. You can enter these commands in the descriptions or comments of issues, epics, merge requests, and commits. Be sure to enter each quick action on a separate line to allow GitLab to properly detect and execute the commands. Source: [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html)

- `/estimate`
- `/remove_estimate`
- `/spend`
- `/remove_time_spent`

Eg. `/spend 30m`

You can view a breakdown of time spent on an issue or merge request.

To view a time tracking report:
1. Go to an issue or a merge request.
2. In the right sidebar, select Time tracking report.

## How to enter command with password for git pull?

For http(s):
- you can put the password in `.netrc` file (_netrc on windows). From there it would be picked up automatically. It would go to your home folder with 600 permissions.
- you could also just clone the repo with `https://user:pass@domain/repo` but that's not really recommended as it would show your user/pass in a lot of places...
- a new option is to use the credential helper. Note that credentials would be stored in clear text in your local config using standard credential helper. credential-helper with wincred can be also used on windows.

Usage examples for credential helper
- `git config credential.helper store` - stores the credentials indefinitely.
- `git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'`- stores for 60 minutes

For ssh-based access, you'd use ssh agent that will provide the ssh key when needed. This would require generating keys on your computer, storing the public key on the remote server and adding the private key to relevant keystore.

## How do I push a new local branch to a remote Git repository and track it too?

In Git 1.7.0 and later, you can checkout a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch>
```

Edit files, add and commit. Then push with the -u (short for `--set-upstream`) option:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch>
```

Git will set up the tracking information during the push.

## Squash commits and merge on new branch

```bash
# create a new branch
git checkout -b new_clean_branch

# apply all changes
git merge original_messy_branch

# forget the commits but have the changes staged for commit
git reset --soft main        

git commit -m "Squashed changes from original_messy_branch"
```

## How do I delete a Git branch locally and remotely?

Executive Summary
```bash
$ git push -d <remote_name> <branchname>
$ git branch -d <branchname>
```

Note: In most cases, `<remote_name>` will be origin.

Delete Local Branch

To delete the local branch use one of the following:
```bash
$ git branch -d <branch_name>
$ git branch -D <branch_name>
```

- The -d option is an alias for --delete, which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged in its upstream branch.
- The -D option is an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status." [Source: man git-branch]
- As of Git v2.3, git branch -d (delete) learned to honor the -f (force) flag.
- You will receive an error if you try to delete the currently selected branch.

Delete Remote Branch

As of Git v1.7.0, you can delete a remote branch using

`$ git push <remote_name> --delete <branch_name>`

which might be easier to remember than

`$ git push <remote_name> :<branch_name>`

which was added in Git v1.5.0 "to delete a remote branch or a tag."

Starting with Git v2.8.0, you can also use git push with the -d option as an alias for --delete. Therefore, the version of Git you have installed will dictate whether you need to use the easier or harder syntax.
