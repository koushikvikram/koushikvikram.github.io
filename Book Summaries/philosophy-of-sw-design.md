## 1. Introduction (It's All About Complexity)

> Preface

**Definitions:**
- Problem Decomposition: *Taking a complex problem and dividing it up into pieces that can be solved independently.*

**Summary:**
- *Problem Decomposition* is the most fundamental problem in Computer Science
    - *Reducing complexity* is the overall goal
    - Central design task that programmers face everyday
    - Separates great programmers from average ones

**Notes:**
- Software design principles in this book are fairly high level and border on the philosophical
- Learn in an iterative process. Learn the principles and work through a series of projects to assimilate and practice them
- Write code, make mistakes and then see how these mistakes and subsequent fixes relate to the principles
- While developing a substantial piece of software from scratch
    - Go through extensive code reviews to identify design problems
    - Revise projects to fix the problems
