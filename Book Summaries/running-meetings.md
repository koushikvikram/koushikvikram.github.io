## 2. Introduction

Unproductive meetings are frustrating for everyone because they waste time. **Thoughtful preparation, active meeting management skills, and strong follow-up** can make the difference between a rewarding, enjoyable, and invigorating session and one in which everyone doodles and avoids eye contact.

The discipline and time you invest before, during, and after will pay off for your team and for you: In the meeting you’ll be able to communicate, build consensus, and get things done — and you’ll earn a reputation as a productive meeting leader in your organization as well.

Running effective meetings is a skill that is critical all the way up to the C-suite level.

### Identify the specific purpose of the meeting (Why are you meeting?)

- Fundamental step. Drives all the other elements.
- Be as specific as possible as you think through what the gathering needs to accomplish. You'll be far more likely to include just the individuals who specifically need to be there, and in turn, they'll be on hand to give their feedback about options and to endorse the decision as it is made.
- If your purpose is vague, like "discuss the Special Revenue-Generating project" instead of something specific like "reprioritize workload", "get a status update" or "brainstorm ways to speed up the timetable", you and your attendees will all come into the room with totally different ideas of what you'll get out of the meeting and leave everyone frustrated and dissatisfied.

### Make sure your need a meeting at all

As you plan, keep asking yourself whether the meeting is really necessary. If there is another better way to accomplish your goal, go for it.

It’s better not to hold a meeting if:
1. You don’t have time to prepare for the meeting.
2. Another method of communicating—email, phone, text message—would work as well or better.
3. The subject isn’t worth everyone’s time.
4. Your group members are upset over a conflict or other problem and need time apart before being ready and able to address the situation.
5. The subject is a personnel issue that’s better handled one-on-one, such as gathering information from others about an employee’s poor performance.
6. You need to solicit a number of individuals’ opinions.

### Develop a preliminary agenda
